  ///  Returns a `new` String  with the center-padded version of `self` if it's shorter than `length` using a `token`. Padding characters are truncated if they can't be evenly divided by length.
  ///
  /// Example 1:
  ///
  ///     let string = "Hello World"
  ///     string.padding(length: 13) -> " Hello World "
  ///
  /// Example 2:
  ///
  ///     let string = "Hello World"
  ///     string.padding(length: 13, withToken: "*") -> "*Hello World*"
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - length: The final length of your string. If the provided length is less than or equal to the original string, the original string is returned.
  ///   - token: The string used to pad the String (Defaults to a white space).
  /// - Returns: The padded copy of the string.
